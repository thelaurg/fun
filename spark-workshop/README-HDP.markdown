This workshop demonstrates how to write and run [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) *Big Data* applications within a special, extended version of the Hortonworks Sandbox, version 2.1. This version was extended by Hortonworks and Typesafe to add the [Spark 1.1](https://spark.apache.org) distribution and the [Typesafe Reactive Platform](https://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted), including an *Activator* template called [Spark Workshop](https://typesafe.com/activator/template/spark-workshop). You are reading the introduction to this workshop.

For more advanced Spark training and services from Typesafe, please visit [typesafe.com/reactive-big-data](http://www.typesafe.com/platform/reactive-big-data/spark).

Login as `root` (password `hadoop`) and run the script `spark-workshop/start.sh` to launch the [Activator](http://typesafe.com/activator) environment with its web UI. The script will echo a message to the console with the URL to view the UI.

The UI shows the tutorial for this project and it allows you to browse the code, compile, test, and run it.
